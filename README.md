# WoW Format Test
Messing around with parsing WoW file formats for educational purposes.
Built from the ground up, but with lots of copy pasta from older projects (noted in thanks paragraph).

## Supported expansions
Built for (latest) Warlords of Draenor files. Backwards compatibility with Mists of Pandaria not guaranteed. Cataclysm and lower probably won't work at all.

MPQ support is currently not planned. Very basic support for the new CASC file format introduced in Warlords of Draenor is present. It can only download content from Blizzard's servers, not load storages already present on HDD (yet).

## Configuration
Should be no configuration neccesary at the time of writing. 

## Requirements
- [CSDBCReader](http://marlamin.com/u/CSDBCReader.dll)
- [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/) (recent version already included)
