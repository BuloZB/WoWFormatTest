== TODO ==
* Alpha issues (relaxok says I need to render all opaque things first, makes sense but FUCK)
* Rotation issues (some small rotation issues remain)
* Water
* Multiple texture layers (shader magic or rendering everything 4 times)
* Optimization
* Local file loading (hackfixed while TOM fixes his library to use different file stuff)
* WMO doodads
* Refactor WMO, M2 and BLP loading to be the same code in both TerrainWindow.cs and Render.cs
* Ortho camera
